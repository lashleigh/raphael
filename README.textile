h3. How to use the playground (on a Mac)

* Clone this project into your Sites directory
* Open up http://10.0.0.102/~YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE/raphael/index.html
* Enjoy!

I've only played with it using Google Chrome browser. There is some logic in
the javascript that sizes elements to fit full screen on your monitor. I find it 
most enjoyable to view the page in full screen mode.
